The Lana Del Rey Gallery is a website dedicated to fans of Lana Del Rey, allowing them to upload and download photos of the artist. This platform aims to create a collaborative and organized space where fans can share and enjoy high-quality images of Lana Del Rey. The project was developed as part of my learning journey in the CS50 course and represents a significant milestone in applying web development skills. Drawing inspiration from forums and fan communities on the internet, I sought to create a platform that is both functional and welcoming.
